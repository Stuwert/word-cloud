## My Plan

I'm going to iterate through the object, grab the key for the array, iterate through the array, split up the words in the string, search the object for the key, add to the count, search for the person, push the person if it's new.

Functions:
- search
  - ##key in object
  - ##person in array
- push
  - ##adds item to an array
  - ##adds new value to existing key
  - ##creates new key in array
- parse
  - ##run through the array
  - ### split out the words
  - iterate through the words
